# In My Life

by Jason Zeng

# Project Overview

The concept of "community" always meant family to me. To better illustrate, it doesn't merely confine to biological family but also includes those who make up who you are, as their influence was part of your development which then formed your identity. During the pandemic, the cruel reality of social isolation gave me a deep lesson regarding to this notion. For 13 years of my life, I was raised around my community in China, so not being to see them the first year of pandemic was brutal to me, since I just came to state a year ago at that time, all the people I knew or fond with were literally all across the sea. Then when I finally had the chance to go back for the following summer, there was a mandatory 2 week of isolation required in China for visitors outside of country. It never occurred to me, how precious and invaluable it is to see people who we love right before this experience. Having to pay the price of being locked up in a room, just in order to see someone. I'd never have imagined that before pandemic. Yet, I was fully committed and I still believe that's the power of family, that emotions of this nature genuinely drive us to do things beyond our limits. The days of only being able to see them in a phone screen makes me realize that how precious this community is as a platform of sentiments and emotions. 

I really miss my community back home as I haven't found the same belonging around me. Making my way as an adult outside the confines of my childhood community, although I feel relatively ready since I'm very much accustomed to it. I often see myself as a bridge for which I exchange my value and culture shaped by my community with someone else's. This is extremely important to me, it acts as an invitation to join my community and be part of it. It means to appreciate the culture represents behind this community. Likewise, if someone else's community is defined by something else, they can similarly invite me to join their community and try to be one of them. Overall, exchanging the notion of community is expressing our inner self, show others who we identify as and we get to celebrate each other's differences.

# Project Details

The passages I chose are from "In My Life by the Beatles", although the song itself sounds more like a love song that describes a romantic relationship, the lyrics still click to me and my sense of community. For example, this short excerpt

"There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain"

I think it expresses the homesick feeling perfectly, captures that yearning of reliving those heartwarming moments in relation to those special places, as if traveling back to the past.

"All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all"

Then life struck us with the reality, poking the bubble of fantasy, all that remains are those fond memories that are so sweet yet agonizing.Though

"I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more"

No matter how hard life is, we have family to back us up and keep fighting for what we believe in. For people who went before us, they deserve our gratitude towards them, we simply love them more.

# Technical Overview

HTML is my basic structure that sets up the website. 

### Font Choice
1. Reenie Beanie https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Reenie+Beanie

2. Caveat Brush https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat+Brush

3. Rock 3D https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rock+3D

Both font family are in handwritten style, Caveat Brush has a thicker touch while the Reenie Beanie has much thinner lines to construct a contrast that makes certain words pop out more. That being said, I also appreciate the warm feeling behind these handwritten fonts, it feels less digital and cold. Lastly, the Rock 3D font was added for more chracter and expression. The cute 3d font gives me a childish feeling which suits the content incredibly well since it's about memory of past life and childhood.
